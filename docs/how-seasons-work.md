# How Seasons Work

Seasons let you track cumulative standings across multiple events. Think of it like a championship series where each event is one "game."

---

## What Is a Season?

A season is a collection of related events with combined standings.

**Examples:**
- **Road to WrestleMania** — Saturday Night's Main Event → Royal Rumble → Elimination Chamber → WrestleMania
- **Awards Season** — Golden Globes → SAG Awards → Oscars
- **Playoff Run** — Wild Card → Divisional → Conference Championship → Super Bowl

## How Points Work

Your season score = sum of your points from each event you participated in.

| Event | Your Points |
|-------|-------------|
| Event 1 | 45 |
| Event 2 | 38 |
| Event 3 | 52 |
| **Season Total** | **135** |

Simple addition. No multipliers. No bonuses.

## Joining a Season

**Important:** Joining a pool does NOT automatically add you to a season.

Season participation is opt-in. You choose whether to be part of the season standings.

This means:
- You can play individual events without season pressure
- You only see season standings if you've joined
- Your friends who just want to do one event aren't forced into comparison

## Season Standings

The season standings page shows:

| Rank | Name | Events Entered | Total Points |
|------|------|----------------|--------------|
| 1 | Sarah | 3 | 135 |
| 2 | Mike | 3 | 128 |
| 3 | Jordan | 2 | 89 |

**Events Entered** = how many events you've participated in. Someone who missed an event will have fewer opportunities for points.

## Late Joiners

Can you join a season after it's started? Yes!

- You'll get zero points for events you missed
- You can still compete in remaining events
- You'll just be behind (which is fair)

## Viewing Season Standings

If you're in a pool that's part of a season, you'll see a link:

> 🏆 View [Season Name] Standings

Click it to see the cumulative leaderboard across all season events.

## Season vs. Pool

Don't confuse these:

| Concept | What It Is |
|---------|------------|
| **Pool** | A group of people playing together for ONE event |
| **Season** | A collection of events with combined standings |

You can have:
- Multiple pools for the same event (different friend groups)
- One season spanning multiple events
- A pool that's NOT part of any season

---

## Example: Road to WrestleMania

**Season:** Road to WrestleMania 42

**Events in the season:**
1. Saturday Night's Main Event (January)
2. Royal Rumble (February)
3. Elimination Chamber (March)
4. WrestleMania 42 (April)

**How it works:**
- Each event has its own pool(s)
- Each event has its own deadline and picks
- Season standings accumulate after each event
- The season champion is crowned after WrestleMania

## FAQ

**Q: Do I have to join the season?**
A: No! Seasons are opt-in. You can play individual events without tracking season standings.

**Q: What if I miss an event?**
A: You get zero points for that event. You can still compete in future events.

**Q: Can the same person win multiple events AND the season?**
A: Absolutely. Consistency (or luck) pays off!

**Q: Is there a season prize?**
A: That's up to your group! PickCrown is bragging rights only. But feel free to add your own stakes.
