# How to Run a Family Pool

A simple guide to setting up and running a PickCrown pool for your family, friends, or coworkers.

---

## What You'll Need

- An event to pick (Oscars, March Madness, Super Bowl, etc.)
- Email addresses of your participants
- 5 minutes to set it up

---

## Step 1: Get Your Pool Link

Your pool commissioner (probably you!) will create the pool and share a link that looks like:

```
https://pickcrown.vercel.app/pool/abc123...
```

That's it. No app to download. No accounts to create.

---

## Step 2: Share the Link

Send the link to your group however you normally communicate:

- Family group chat
- Email
- Text message
- Slack channel

**Pro tip:** Include the deadline! Something like:

> "Here's our Oscars pool! Get your picks in by Sunday 7pm ET → [link]"

---

## Step 3: Everyone Makes Their Picks

When people click the link, they'll:

1. Enter their email address
2. Choose a display name (like "Uncle Steve" or "The Oracle")
3. Make their picks
4. Submit

No password. No account. Just picks.

---

## Step 4: Wait for Lock

Once the event starts (or the deadline passes), picks automatically lock. No one can see anyone else's picks until then.

**This is important:** People can change their picks right up until lock time. Encourage last-minute changes if they want!

---

## Step 5: Watch Results Together

After the event, check the standings page to see:

- Who's winning
- Final rankings
- The champion 👑

The winner gets bragging rights. That's it. That's the prize.

## Tips for a Great Pool

### Set Clear Expectations
- "This is just for fun"
- "Winner picks the restaurant next time"
- "Loser has to wear the ugly sweater"

### Use Pool Notes
As commissioner, you can add notes that everyone sees:
- House rules
- Tiebreaker rules
- What the winner gets

### Don't Stress About Stragglers
The manage page shows "18 of 22 submitted" so you know who's in. A friendly reminder the day before usually does the trick.

### Keep It Light
PickCrown is designed for fun, not serious competition. No money. No pressure. Just picks and bragging rights.

## Common Questions

**Q: What if someone forgets to submit?**
A: They just don't get counted. No picks = no points. Life goes on!

**Q: Can people change their picks?**
A: Yes, anytime before lock. Their last submission is what counts.

**Q: Do I need to manually score everything?**
A: For most events, the commissioner enters results as they happen. The system calculates scores automatically.

**Q: What if there's a tie?**
A: Ties are fine! Multiple people can share a rank. It's friendlier that way.

## You're Ready!

That's really all there is to it. PickCrown handles the mechanics so you can focus on the fun part: watching the event together and seeing who called it.

Good luck! 🍀
