# What PickCrown Is Not

PickCrown is built around a specific philosophy. Understanding what we *don't* do helps explain why the product feels the way it does.

---

## Not a Betting Platform

**No money changes hands through PickCrown.**

- No entry fees
- No prize pools
- No odds or spreads
- No gambling hooks

**Why:** We're for bragging rights, not bankrolls. The moment money gets involved, the vibe shifts from "fun with friends" to "I need to win this back." That's not us.

If your group wants to put something on the line, that's your business — but PickCrown won't facilitate it.

---

## Not a Social Network

**No profiles. No followers. No feeds.**

- No friend requests
- No public profiles
- No activity feeds
- No "trending" anything
- No likes, comments, or reactions

**Why:** Social features create pressure. They turn a casual pool into a performance. We don't want you thinking about how your picks look to strangers. We want you thinking about whether the Knicks can cover.

---

## Not a Public Leaderboard

**Pools are private by default.**

- No global rankings
- No public pool directory
- No way to browse other people's pools
- No "top pickers" showcase

**Why:** Public leaderboards create hierarchy. They make casual players feel bad. They attract people who optimize instead of enjoy. PickCrown is for your group, not the world.

---

## Not a Notification Machine

**We email you twice, max.**

- One reminder before picks lock
- One results email when the event ends

That's it. No:
- "Someone joined your pool!"
- "Your friend made their picks!"
- "Don't forget to check standings!"
- Weekly digests
- Push notifications
- Marketing emails

**Why:** Notification anxiety is real. Every buzz on your phone is a small tax on your attention. We refuse to be part of that problem.

---

## Not a Live Scoring App

**No real-time updates. No play-by-play.**

- No live scores
- No push alerts when you gain/lose points
- No "your pick just lost!" notifications

**Why:** Live scoring creates anxiety. It turns watching the game into watching your score. We want you to enjoy the event, then check standings when it's done.

---

## Not a Data Platform

**We don't sell your data. We don't show you ads.**

- No tracking pixels
- No behavioral advertising
- No "we noticed you like basketball" recommendations

**Why:** You're not the product. Your pool is.

---

## Not for Strangers

**PickCrown is designed for people who know each other.**

- Private, invite-only pools
- No way to discover or join random pools
- No matchmaking with strangers

**Why:** Playing with strangers changes behavior. People get meaner. They take it too seriously. They ruin the vibe. We're for your family, your friends, your coworkers — people you'll see again.

---

## Not Trying to "Engage" You

**We're not optimizing for time-on-site.**

- No gamification (streaks, badges, achievements)
- No "complete your profile" nagging
- No dark patterns to keep you scrolling

**Why:** Our goal is simple: help you run a pool, then get out of the way. If you only open PickCrown twice a year, that's fine. We're not trying to become a habit.

---

## What We Actually Are

PickCrown is the **least stressful way to run something people care about.**

- Make picks
- See who wins
- Celebrate together
- Move on with your life

That's it. That's the whole thing.

---

## The Vibe, Summarized

> "It's like a shared spreadsheet, but actually nice to use, and nobody can accidentally delete the formulas."

We're not trying to be exciting. We're trying to be calm, reliable, and fun. Like a good party game that doesn't overstay its welcome.

## If You Want More...

If you're looking for:
- Live scoring → Try ESPN or Yahoo
- Betting → Try DraftKings or FanDuel
- Social features → Try Twitter or Discord
- Competition with strangers → Try a public bracket challenge

Those are fine products for different needs. PickCrown is for something simpler.

**Bragging rights only.** 😄
